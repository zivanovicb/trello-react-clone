# [Trello](http://www.trello.com") clone 


I've read somewhere they were using Backbone as a front-end framework. 
<br />
I will try to clone significant parts of this web app using **_React/Redux_** which I've been playing with lately and **_Firebase Realtime Database_**.
<br />
Srr is on the way also since flash at initial load feels bad and it's the way Trello is built.
